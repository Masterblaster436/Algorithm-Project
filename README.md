# Algorithm-Project
This program will display a list of members from a family tree. Depending on the 2 members the user selects, the program will show the relationship between them.

This program relies on splitting the list of members into many categories and comparing them using numerous "if" statements and the like.

For example, if Rosanne and Donnie are selected, the program will show that Rosanne is a sibling of Donnie, since they have the same parents.
